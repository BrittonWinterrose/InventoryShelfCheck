# InventoryShelfCheck
Smooth little 1 page application that you use  look up what products are on a specific shelf to print a list for manual inventory cycle counts. Uses google sheets & forms as a database for the back end. Works great with the inventoryDatabase spreadsheets app I built. 

Copy this google spreadsheets to your own google drive:

Inventory Location - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zpr9EPaNJ_2FOCCV7ca0iAjjeIV9H59tI6gVNso28qE

(the form should be automatically generated and accessable through the Inventory Location Spreadsheet)

Replace the variables value on it's respective line in the ShelfCheck.html file using the strings from your google spreadsheet URL's on lines 47. 

Save to your webserver and launch! Enjoy entering various items and being able to look them up using the google sheet or the app.
